Mythical Pet Universe (MPU) - README

Getting Started

To run the Mythical Pet Universe game, follow these simple steps:



File Organization


All class files (e.g., PetManager.java, GameEngine.java, ScreenManager.java, etc.) should go in the src folder.



Running the Game

Ensure you have JavaFX set up in your IDE or build environment. JavaFX is required to run the graphical interface.

Compile and run Main.java. This will launch the start menu of Mythical Pet Universe.





Dependencies

Make sure that all JavaFX libraries are added to your classpath.

If you use an IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse), set the JavaFX SDK path in your project settings.




Usage Instructions

Use the GUI to adopt pets, manage them, and play mini-games (e.g., FireControlSimulator and SkydivingGame).

Health and in-game currency are updated based on your actions in the mini-games.





Troubleshooting

If the game doesnâ€™t start, make sure all files are correctly placed in the src folder and the JavaFX setup is configured.

Java version 11 or above is recommended.

Enjoy taking care of mythical pets and playing exciting mini-games!
